# DTrace: beyond Instruments

This repository contains my slides and examples from the workshop I hosted at FrenchKit 2016.

## Update

Thanks for attending! Feel free to contact me on Twitter (@franklefebvre) for additional questions.

__Question__: How can I export/import my custom instruments?

__Answer__: Your custom instruments are stored as individual XML files in `~/Library/Application Support/Instruments/PlugIns/Instruments/`.
